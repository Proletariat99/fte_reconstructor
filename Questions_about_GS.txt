 Generic Questions about GS:
1. How are you getting your data in the proper format for Pdata.dat and Bdata.dat?
2. What do the following variables represent:
	- bc - B-Field - Comes from <Bxx, Byy, Bzz>?
	- ncase - 
	- vp - Plasma Bulk Velocity - Comes from ?
	- ndata	
	- x - Xcoordinate (RE?) But which one?
	- y - y coordinate (RE?) But which one?
	- u - 
	- udy
	- udx
	- fpbz1
	- c1

Specific, Succinct Questions for Stefan/WLT:

General Notes:
Overall Procedure
	- I assume the order is as follows: 
		1) MVAB (bc,ncase)
		2) DHT (bc,vp,ncase)
		3) IRMgs ()

DeHoffman-Teller Analysis
	- You can do HT Analysis based on E&B, or B & Vp (Plasma Bulk Velocity).  We are doing the latter.  In this case, we use -v x B as the "E term."  
	- The process is a "non-iterative", least squares method.  
	- Are we ignoring error?  
	- 9.3 contains the actual procedure for finding a value of Vht from B and Vp.  
	- 9.5 concerns accelerating HT frames (doesn't apply to us?  What about rotation?)  
	-  

Finished:
DHT.m - Input: Bdata.dat, Pdata.dat, # of lines in Bdata.dat
	Output: HT Frame Velocity (in what coordinate system?)
MVAB.m - Input: Bdata.dat, # of lines in Bdata.dat
	 Output: maxvv (max variance?), intvv (intermediate variance?), minvv (minimum variance?), qratio (quality ratio), lamda1 (eigenvalue1), lamda2 (eigenvalue2), lamda3 (eigenvalue3)

IRMgs.m - 	Input: 
		Output: 
	CM = 3x3 matrix - rotation matrix 	1	0	0
						0	1	0
						0	0	1	(because phi = 0)

	XZ - Z axis 
	Kbmax - 
	XZ = CM*XZ (rotates the old XZ into new XZ)
	theta - hard coded 
	phi - 0 - hard coded - change for best value.
	zs = unit vector (are we sure about this?)
	UPPERCASE = Matrix?
	lowercase = vector?
	xs = x'
	ys = y'
	vhtsn = unit vector
	ys = y unit vector = z <cross> x
	why isn't theta/phi a keyword?
	V0=V0*xs = velocity along x axis.
	dTim1 = equitemporal -- THEMIS is already equitemporal (3 seconds apart)


To Do:
+ Modify ASCII file generation to make just one megafile 
+ Keep only GSM components
+ Interpolate from Stefan
- eV to MK (10^6 Kelvin)
- Define Boltzmann Constant and such.
+ Generate two files or modify.
- Leave input file in eV and change the line MK to modify from eV (like line 10)
- 1) Make sure files are on same time step.
+ 2) prepare a file that looks like his.
+ 3) Keep GSM field and velocities in one file (change code to import)
- 4) Fix temperature unit issue.
+ 5) USE HIS FORMAT - 
- 6) Keep temperature in eV
- 7) Comment out the cx, cy section for time step (dtime)
- 8) Still need to have the first value of the time matrix be 0.  

	Del cross A = B
	pp = Plasma pressure
	Bzn = Bz normal?
	nden = factor because the density
	Nx - comes from file = density



TO DO 
- Interpolate Temp and Density to same time step as B
-
